\title{ Preliminary look at road cost data}

\begin{document}
\maketitle


The World Bank maintains the Road Costs Knowledge (ROCKS) database,
which compiles data on the cost of road construction
projects\footnote{https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/reports/thematic-reports/road-costs-knowledge-system}. ROCKS
was first compiled in *** for *** y. It was updated by the Doing
Business group in XXX to cover projects that took place between X and
Y. A single project may involve
multiple components, which are segments of roads, and each component
may be comprised of different road sections. A given project may
have interesting variation between its components and sections.
However, this document focuses on costs at the project level,
therefore the unit of analysis is a road construction project. The dataset consists of \Sexpr{n.projects} distinct projects in
\Sexpr{n.countries} different countries. Figure \ref{fig_world_map}
maps the extent of coverage around the world.
