\title{A gentle introduction to data visualization in R for TAP Striking
  Statistics}
\date{March 2020}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Goals of this tutorial}

It is often easier and quicker to communicate coding concepts
    in an interactive in-person workshop. We are unlikely to have that
    opportunity soon. The idea of this tutorial is to have some
    self-guided examples, followed by a virtual Q\&A session
 
I have selected resources and examples with two goals in mind:
\begin{enumerate}
\item You can explore examples with enough background information to
  get a fair feel for the possibilities and challenges of data
  visualization in R
  \item We have enough of a shared understanding to jointly edit the
    occasional visualation, even if we use mostly use different
    tools

    \begin{framed}
    For example, a few weeks ago we needed to change a couple
    of maps to represent Western Sahara. Alexis had the correct
    shapefiles; Hannah and I had two different maps produced with two
    different workflows. If we had been a bit more coordinated,
    changing the underlying maps would have involved one line of reproducible
    code. (See example \ref{tap_map}). As it was, Hannah and I painted
    over our existing maps in Microsoft Paint.
  \end{framed}
\end{enumerate}
    
  \textbf{This is not}
\begin{itemize}
\item  A comprehensive introduction to R, to
      data visualization or even to data visualization in R
\item (Yet {\tt:-)}) An evangelistic mission to convert everyone to R
  
\end{itemize}

  Significant complementarities to other analytical skills
  (statistical analysis, data wrangling incl. web scraping etc.,
  machine learning...)&High barriers to entry make collaboration more difficult\\
  Lots of active development for new data viz tools &\\

\section{Basic setup}
\begin{itemize}
\item Download and install R from the R-project website
  \url{https://www.r-project.org/about.html}


  \item Download and install the free version of RStudio
    \url{https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}

      Please follow the defaults unless you have a good reason not to.
